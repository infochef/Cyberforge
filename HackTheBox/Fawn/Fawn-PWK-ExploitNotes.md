# Fawn — Easy

**Author:** Somnath   
**IP:** 10.129.168.15  
**OS:** Linux  
**Date:** 2025-10-21  

## Summary
Misconfigured FTP allows anonymous access to configuration/backup files containing credentials, which pivot to user and root compromise.

---

## Enumeration
**Nmap command:**  
\`\`\`bash
nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap_initial.txt 10.129.168.15
\`\`\`

**Key ports / services:**  
- 80/HTTP —  webserver runs on port 80
- 22/SSH — SSH runs on port 22
- 21/FTP - FTP was running on port 21

**Web discovery (gobuster/ferox):**  
- `/admin` — note

---

## Initial Access
**Vector / vuln:**  
- Explanation of the vulnerability. - Anonymous/misconfigured FTP allowed access to backup/config files containing plaintext credentials, which were used to gain initial shell access.

**Commands used / exploit:**  
\`\`\`bash
	1. ping 10.129.168.15  
	2. sudo nmap 10.129.168.15
	3. sudo nmap -sV 10.129.168.15
	4. sudo apt install ftp -y
	5. ftp -?
	6. ftp 10.129.168.15
	7. get flag.txt
	8. bye
	9. ls
	10. cat flag.txt
# example commands/payloads used
\`\`\`
	No external payloads were used

## Mitigation
- **Disable anonymous FTP access** immediately to prevent unauthorized logins.
- **Restrict FTP access** to specific trusted IP addresses or internal networks only.
- **Enforce user authentication** with strong, unique credentials instead of anonymous or default accounts.
- **Remove sensitive files** (e.g., configuration or backup files) from FTP directories accessible to users.
- **Use secure protocols** such as SFTP or FTPS instead of plain FTP to encrypt data in transit.
- **Review and harden FTP permissions**, ensuring least-privilege access (read/write only where necessary).
- **Regularly audit FTP directories** and logs to detect any unauthorized access or suspicious activity.
- **Apply principle of least privilege** to the FTP service account and underlying file system.
- **Update and patch FTP server software** to the latest stable version to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Implement centralized credential management** to prevent credential reuse and exposure in configuration files.

## Takeaways / Notes
-  FTP - The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard communication protocol used to transfer computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a client– server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, generally in the form of a username and password. However, they can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
